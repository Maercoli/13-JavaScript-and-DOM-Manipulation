## JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Project goal and actions:

The goal of this project is to create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided by ALIENS-R-REAL. This company has a large collection of information and needs to have this online so their dedicated followers will locate specific reports easily.

## My Task

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* I created a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote a code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Note that the table has a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* I used a date form in your HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searchs through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* I completed all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, I wrote JavaScript code that allows the user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
