##JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Project goal and actions:

The goal of this project is to create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided by ALIENS-R-REAL. This company has a large collection of information 
and needs to put this online so their dedicated followers will stop complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports. 

In order to reach this goal, I took the following steps: 


* Part 1 - Automatic Table and Date Search 

1 - I created a HTML web page.
2 - Using the UFO dataset provided (an array of JavaScript objects), I wrote a code that appended a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
